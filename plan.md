# Plan for npm Utility Connector

## Notes
- User wants to create an npm utility from scratch.
- No dependencies should be used.
- The utility should be innovative and act as a connector.
- The end goal is to publish it on npm.
- User chose package name: "uniconnect".
- Target platform: Node.js 18+.
- First connector to implement: Event â†” AsyncIterable (unifies EventEmitter, EventTarget, AsyncIterable with operators).
- Architecture and API designed and implemented (see src/index.js)
- Documentation, license, and tests written (see README.md, LICENSE, test/smoke.mjs)
- Package.json and npm metadata prepared
- README will be in English
- Author: Gzeu
- Repository: https://github.com/Gzeu/uniconnect.git
- Use a professional README template
- Further optimize code and documentation per user request
- Feature-complete: zero dependencies, expanded operator set, all tests pass
- User requested to add security and persistence/resilience tests
- User requested to improve connector code for security/resilience if npm allows
- Security/resilience features and input validation implemented
- Professional-grade TypeScript types and documentation added
- Full CI and test coverage in progress (target: 1000 tests)
- Tests must explicitly close async iterators or abort with AbortController to avoid lingering promises and ensure clean shutdown (test stabilization)
- User now requests 1000 tests, each with a timeout to avoid hangs
- Multi-connection support is required and implemented; tested with merge, overflow, rapid open/close, and backpressure scenarios.
- Dedicated multi-connection test file (test/multi-connections.test.mjs) added and stabilized; tests include cleanup, AbortController, and listener checks.
- Test stabilization and tuning for timeouts, event count, and resource cleanup is ongoing.
- User clarified: tests are not important, focus should be on improving the connector code in src/index.js; it is acceptable for the package to only contain index.js if needed.
- User requested continued development based on instructions in src/instructiuni.md.
- Minimalist packaging is acceptable: just src/index.js, with optional index.d.ts and focused README.
- User requested to clean up/remove unnecessary tests and test infrastructure before further development.
- Error handling improvements started: specific error types, better error messages, and code review-driven refactor in progress
- Memory management improved: enhanced event listener cleanup and queue management to prevent leaks
- Performance optimizations: debounceTime and throttleTime refactored for efficiency and minimal memory use
- merge and zip operators reimplemented with improved backpressure, error handling, and resource management
- Optional improvements from instructiuni.md: add JSDoc and/or index.d.ts, extend input validation (queueLimit, onOverflow), ensure all main combinators accept { signal }, and allow minimalist packaging (remove tests/, simplify package.json, focused README).
- withQueue utility implemented and integrated in index.js
- JSDoc comments added to main entry points
- README updated with all recent improvements and API changes
- User explicitly allows further expert-level improvements as long as zero dependencies are kept
- Core connector code (createAsyncQueue, fromEventTarget, fromEventEmitter) optimized for performance and memory management with expert-level improvements and weak reference-based handler caches
- withQueue.js finalized and optimized for memory, performance, and error handling
- README documentation for withQueue utility added and finalized
- TypeScript definitions and main exports finalized and synchronized with implementation
- Package version bumped to 0.2.0 for release
- User requests 1000+ concurrent performance, security, and code tests for final validation
- Comprehensive suite of 1000+ performance, security, and concurrency tests created and integrated for validation
- Error classes moved to src/errors.js to resolve circular dependency between index.js and withQueue.js
- Explore new innovative connector patterns and utilities with zero dependencies (e.g., cross-process connectors, browser-to-node bridges, streaming adapters, plug-in operator support, dynamic runtime operator injection, connectors for WebSockets/MessagePorts/SharedArrayBuffer, advanced resource cleanup strategies, and built-in diagnostics/metrics APIs)
- Worker utilities (fromWorker, toWorker, createWorker) implemented for robust cross-thread async integration with zero dependencies
- Worker utilities refactored into a dedicated module with a local queue implementation to avoid circular dependencies and duplicate exports
- Comprehensive worker tests and a new, minimal test runner added for validation
- Test utilities expanded for robust, clear test reporting
- Refocus: Worker utilities are an optional, well-documented extension; the main goal remains a cohesive, zero-dependency connector core (Event/AsyncIterable unification) with minimal, robust worker integration.
- Worker utilities now support both browser and Node.js environments (mock worker for Node.js); all worker utility tests pass in Node.js.
- User requested a clean, modular project structure as outlined (operators/, sources/, utils/, tests/ by type, etc.) and removal of unused or obsolete files/code for the final package.
- Directory restructuring and modularization process started (creating operators/, sources/, utils/, test/unit, etc.); next: move code and remove obsolete files/code.
- Operator and source modularization in progress: map.js, filter.js, merge.js, zip.js, scan.js, distinctUntilChanged.js created in src/operators/; fromEvent.js, fromIterable.js created in src/sources/.
- Next: begin testing the modularized code and operators in their new locations.
